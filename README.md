# brilo

I used Next.js with typescript and tailwind for this project. Great SEO, routing and cashing. Also SSR and CSR is a big plus.

I´m highly skilled in HTML, CSS and javascript, but new changes are coming all the time, so it´s a neverending learning process.

Worked solo and in teams with nette (latte), drupal (twig), react (jsx and tsx). Graphic materials were in Adobe xd, nowadays more in figma.
